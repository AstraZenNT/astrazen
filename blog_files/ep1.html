            <h2><span style="color:rgb(255, 240, 26);">BLOG </span>| Episode 0</h2>
            <h6>*KEYS: Too Dense. Rap = Poetry, Music </h6>
            <p>I was intending for <a href=".../work_files/comics.html">this</a>  to be the official first episode but I ran out of time for a week of deadline, so I just had to abstract things instead that at least I have the essense of it. There might be quite a lot of information in just 6 pages that seems like it's a dense info dump…</p>
            <p>The main inspiration from Episode 0 was the hypothetical of: <i> <span style="color: rgb(255, 231, 98);">"What if we freely chose to exist and suffer than to be nonexistent at all?" </span> </i> – I'll also use this for the next episode.</p>
            <p>Somehow I got interested in <b>rap</b> after completing that week. Maybe it's a way of making the message repeatable/catchy in certain occassions that it'd feel right to listen to. Also that rap is kinda like an informal or more casual way of poetry/lyrics where one doesn't need to be that good of singing as long as they got the foundations - which is the rhythm. With that, I got interested in making my own beats from scratch mainly using my voice on sampling and creating loops. Since I didn't have music in the video version, that got me more compelled to make my own instead so I can use it without worries of copyright from using someone else's. It'd be quite nice to have someone collaborate on creating music someday though.</p>
            <p>That's what I'm planning to integrate on the next projects so I'll have all the major components in Literature; Prose Poetry & Drama.</p>
